## EHA Project Doc Rules

**4-Layer Taxonomy.** All project docs live under `docs/project-docs/`:
- `foundation/` — prd, architecture, workflow, status, phases, changelog, feature-inventory
- `operations/` — ci-cd, production-runbook, governance, compliance, observability, security
- `development/` — testing, api-contract, database, ui-ux, error-handling, internationalization
- `technical-guidelines/` — domain-specific cross-cutting rules (API, database, logging, etc.)

**Legacy/Reference Docs:** Treat folders named `archive/`, `docs-legacy/`, or `reference/` as secondary migration input only, never as authoritative active truth.

**Mandatory core docs:** `index.md`, `getting-started.md`, `foundation/prd.md`, `foundation/architecture.md`, `foundation/workflow.md`, `foundation/status.md`, `operations/ci-cd.md`, `operations/production-runbook.md`, `development/testing.md`, `development/api-contract.md`, `development/database.md`, `development/ui-ux.md`.

**Authority order:** project docs → codebase → agent judgment. When docs conflict, the owning doc wins. When code and docs conflict and authority is unclear, surface the conflict and ask the user — do not guess.

**Universal stable headings (every file):** Description, Important, Table of Contents, Scope, Goals, Non Goals.

**Key ownership rules:**
- Vision, personas, requirements → `foundation/prd.md`
- Stack and architecture → `foundation/architecture.md`
- Dev loop and PR process → `foundation/workflow.md`
- Verification commands and quality gates → `development/testing.md`
- Execution plan and progress → `foundation/status.md`
- Sprint tracking and backlogs → `foundation/phases/`
- Optional doc inventory → `index.md`
- Domain-specific technical rules → `technical-guidelines/` (Create these only for durable cross-cutting rules; avoid placeholders).

**SDD rule:** Specifications dictate implementation. Follow a strict 4-step workflow: 1. Update project docs first, 2. Generate tests based on the specs, 3. Generate code to pass the tests, 4. Logically map every code change back to a spec requirement. Refuse to write code for features not in the spec.

**Flexible Baselines Principle:** Omit docs the repo doesn't need. Mark unknowns as `TBD` or `Assumption`. Mark inferred facts as `Inferred from codebase` until the user confirms them.

# Database Schema Design

Produces a **project-aware, expert-level database schema design or review** by reading the repository's project docs first, then applying a rigorous data modeling method.

This skill is reusable across:

- Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Aurora, etc)
- Document / NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc)
- In-memory / Cache Models (Redis, Memcache, etc)
- Event Stores (Kafka, Pulsar, etc)

It should **not** assume a specific database engine, ORM, or normalization strategy until the project docs confirm them.

## Required Project Inputs

| Document | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/project-docs/development/database.md` | Defines the actual database engines, ORMs, migration tools, naming conventions, and constraints. |
| `docs/project-docs/foundation/architecture.md` | Defines where data logic lives (e.g., repository layer) and integration boundaries. |
| `docs/project-docs/foundation/prd.md` | Clarifies the feature scale, expected data volume, and access patterns. |
| `docs/project-docs/development/testing.md` | Defines how data layer code and migrations should be validated. |

If the repository lacks the database docs needed for the task, call that out and create or update the missing docs instead of inventing local rules in the skill.

## When to Use

Use this skill when designing or reviewing one of these boundary types:

| Boundary type | Typical artifacts |
| --- | --- |
| Schema Creation | Tables, columns, types, constraints, foreign keys, indexes |
| Migrations | Up/Down migration scripts, data backfills, zero-downtime strategies |
| Query Optimization | EXPLAIN plans, index selection, join reduction |
| Data Modeling | Domain entities, aggregates, document embedding vs referencing |
| Caching | Cache keys, TTL strategies, eviction policies |

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Identify the Engine and Tools
Extract from `database.md`:
- the primary database engine (e.g., Postgres 15)
- the schema management/migration tool (e.g., Prisma, Flyway, Alembic)
- the application access pattern (raw SQL vs Query Builder vs ORM)

### Step 2 — Identify the Access Patterns
Extract from `prd.md` and feature docs:
- Read/Write ratios (is it write-heavy or read-heavy?)
- Data volume expectations
- Latency requirements
- Multi-tenant data segregation rules (if any)

### Step 3 — Design the Schema Shape
Design the minimal schema that supports the required behavior.
Specify:
- Entity names and relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
- Strict data types (prefer specific types like `UUID` or `TIMESTAMPTZ` over generic strings if the engine supports it)
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Primary and Foreign keys

### Step 4 — Define Indexing and Performance Strategies
Define the indexes required for the access patterns identified in Step 2.
- Consider composite indexes for multi-column queries.
- Consider partial/filtered indexes for specific status queries.
- Avoid over-indexing to protect write performance.

### Step 5 — Design the Migration Plan
Specify how the schema will be deployed safely:
- Can this be applied without locking tables?
- Does it require a multi-phase zero-downtime migration (e.g., Add column -> write to both -> backfill -> drop old column)?
- How will the rollback (down migration) function?

### Step 6 — Define Verification Requirements
Use `testing.md` to decide how this will be validated.
Examples:
- Schema validation tests
- Query performance benchmarks
- Migration dry-run tests

## Quality Check

Use this checklist when reviewing an existing schema or PR:

- Does the schema follow the project's naming conventions (e.g., snake_case vs camelCase)?
- Are foreign keys properly enforcing referential integrity?
- Are appropriate constraints in place to prevent bad data at the database level?
- Will the migration lock a critical table in production?
- Is there a clear separation between the database schema and the application's domain model?

## Anti-Pattern

- Assuming an ORM is used when the project strictly uses raw SQL.
- Suggesting a heavy relational model for a project that uses a document database.
- Proposing migrations that lock large tables (e.g., adding a column with a default value in older Postgres versions) without a zero-downtime strategy.
- Ignoring data types and using strings for dates, JSON, or booleans.
- Forgetting to define a rollback strategy for a destructive migration.

## Output Contract

When using this skill, the output should include:

1. the database engine and tools being targeted
2. the project docs consulted
3. the proposed schema / entity model
4. indexes and constraints
5. the migration strategy and risk assessment
6. verification strategy
7. open questions regarding data volume or access patterns

## Neutral Prompt Shape
`@agent use db-schema-design on [Target Feature/Entity] focusing on [Specific Requirement/Database Type].`

## Example Prompt
- "Design the schema migration for the new order tracking feature."
- "Optimize the indexing for this query based on read-heavy patterns."
