## EHA Project Doc Rules

**4-Layer Taxonomy.** All project docs live under `docs/project-docs/`:
- `foundation/` — prd, architecture, workflow, status, phases, changelog, feature-inventory
- `operations/` — ci-cd, production-runbook, governance, compliance, observability, security
- `development/` — testing, api-contract, database, ui-ux, error-handling, internationalization
- `technical-guidelines/` — domain-specific cross-cutting rules (API, database, logging, etc.)

**Legacy/Reference Docs:** Treat folders named `archive/`, `docs-legacy/`, or `reference/` as secondary migration input only, never as authoritative active truth.

**Mandatory core docs:** `index.md`, `getting-started.md`, `foundation/prd.md`, `foundation/architecture.md`, `foundation/workflow.md`, `foundation/status.md`, `operations/ci-cd.md`, `operations/production-runbook.md`, `development/testing.md`, `development/api-contract.md`, `development/database.md`, `development/ui-ux.md`.

**Authority order:** project docs → codebase → agent judgment. When docs conflict, the owning doc wins. When code and docs conflict and authority is unclear, surface the conflict and ask the user — do not guess.

**Universal stable headings (every file):** Description, Important, Table of Contents, Scope, Goals, Non Goals.

**Key ownership rules:**
- Vision, personas, requirements → `foundation/prd.md`
- Stack and architecture → `foundation/architecture.md`
- Dev loop and PR process → `foundation/workflow.md`
- Verification commands and quality gates → `development/testing.md`
- Execution plan and progress → `foundation/status.md`
- Sprint tracking and backlogs → `foundation/phases/`
- Optional doc inventory → `index.md`
- Domain-specific technical rules → `technical-guidelines/` (Create these only for durable cross-cutting rules; avoid placeholders).

**SDD rule:** Specifications dictate implementation. Follow a strict 4-step workflow: 1. Update project docs first, 2. Generate tests based on the specs, 3. Generate code to pass the tests, 4. Logically map every code change back to a spec requirement. Refuse to write code for features not in the spec.

**Flexible Baselines Principle:** Omit docs the repo doesn't need. Mark unknowns as `TBD` or `Assumption`. Mark inferred facts as `Inferred from codebase` until the user confirms them.

# wireframing

Produces a project-aware, expert-level wireframe or prototype structure by reading the repository's project docs first, then applying a user-centric structural design methodology.

This skill bridges the gap between the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the final UI/UX implementation. It focuses on layout, information architecture, user journeys, and component structure, deferring specific styling decisions to the UI/UX phase.

## Required Project Inputs

| Document | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/project-docs/foundation/prd.md` | Defines the user personas, core workflows, and required data points for the interface. |
| `docs/project-docs/development/ui-ux.md` | Provides the baseline component vocabulary (e.g., standard layouts, navigation patterns) to reuse. |
| `docs/project-docs/foundation/architecture.md` | Clarifies constraints on client-side vs server-side rendering and data availability. |

If the repository lacks a PRD for the feature being wireframed, call that out and define the user goals before attempting to draw layouts.

## When to Use

Use this skill when planning the structure of a new interface before committing to high-fidelity design or code.

| Boundary type | Typical artifacts |
| --- | --- |
| Page Layout | Grid structures, navigation placement, content zones. |
| User Flow | Multi-step wizards, checkout processes, onboarding journeys. |
| Component Hierarchy | Identifying which logical components are needed on a screen. |
| Information Architecture | Grouping related data, defining hierarchy of importance. |

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Extract User Goals
Extract from `prd.md`: What is the primary objective of the user on this screen? What are the secondary actions? What data must be visible for them to make decisions?

### Step 2 — Define the Information Architecture
Determine the hierarchy of information. The most critical data and primary calls-to-action (CTAs) must sit prominently (e.g., above the fold or in highly accessible areas). Group related information into logical sections or cards.

### Step 3 — Draft the Component Structure
Without writing CSS or final HTML, outline the required components.
For example:
- Navigation Header (Logo, User Menu)
- Hero Section (Primary Title, Main CTA)
- Data Grid (List of items with specific columns)
- Sidebar (Filters, Categories)

### Step 4 — Map the Interaction Flow
Define how the user navigates between states:
- What happens when a button is clicked? (Modal opens, navigation occurs, inline expansion).
- How are empty states represented?
- How are loading and error states handled structurally?

### Step 5 — Produce the Wireframe Representation
Generate a structural representation. This could be a text-based ASCII wireframe, a markdown-based component hierarchy tree, or a Mermaid state diagram representing the flow. Keep it strictly low-fidelity.

## Quality Check

- Is the primary call-to-action immediately obvious in the structure?
- Does the layout follow established patterns from `ui-ux.md`?
- Are edge cases (empty states, errors) accounted for in the flow?
- Is the information hierarchy logical and aligned with the PRD?
- Is the structure free of distracting styling details (colors, exact fonts)?

## Anti-Pattern

- Focusing on colors, typography, or exact pixel padding during the wireframing stage.
- Designing layouts that assume perfect, fully populated data at all times.
- Creating disjointed screens without defining the navigation flow between them.
- Ignoring accessibility concerns regarding logical reading order.

## Output Contract

When using this skill, the output should include:
1. the project docs consulted and user goals assumed
2. the proposed information architecture and data hierarchy
3. a structural wireframe (ASCII, Markdown list, or Diagram)
4. defined interaction flows between states
5. identified edge cases (empty, loading, error states)

## Neutral Prompt Shape
`@agent use wireframing on [Target Feature/Page] focusing on [Specific User Journey].`

## Example Prompt
- "Create a structural wireframe for the new user dashboard."
- "Map out the component hierarchy and interaction flow for the checkout process."
- "Draft a low-fidelity layout for the data analytics page."
